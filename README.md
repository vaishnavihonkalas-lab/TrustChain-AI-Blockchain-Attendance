# TrustChain – AI Assisted Blockchain Attendance System

## Project Overview
TrustChain is a blockchain-based attendance verification prototype designed for educational institutions. It uses Algorand blockchain concepts to securely store attendance records, ensuring transparency, tamper-proof storage, and automated certificate verification.

## Problem Statement
Attendance records in colleges are centralized and can be manipulated. Certificate verification is often slow and unreliable.

## Proposed Solution
TrustChain records attendance securely on blockchain, calculates an AI-inspired trust score, and automatically generates verifiable attendance certificates.

## Key Features
- Blockchain-based attendance recording
- AI-inspired trust score analysis
- Automated certificate generation
- Transparent and secure verification

## Prototype
Prototype designed using AI UI tools demonstrating:
- Attendance marking
- Blockchain transaction simulation
- Trust score dashboard
- Certificate verification

## Future Scope
- Full Algorand blockchain integration
- Smart contract automation
- Real AI attendance analytics
